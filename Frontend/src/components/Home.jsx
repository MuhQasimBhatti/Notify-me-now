          <p className="" >
            When life is unpredictable, don't leave your customers, staff or
            suppliers in the dark - rely on Email alerts or a text message
            notification system to keep everyone informed.
          </p>
          <p >
            No matter the amount of planning that has gone into an event or
            task, change is unavoidable. Wild weather may force an event to be
            rescheduled or cancelled at the last minute. A technical fault may
            affect an essential service. Traffic issues might result in service
            disruptions for local public transport routes. Staff illness may
            require last minute changes to rosters.
          </p>
          <p >
            When plans change, people need to know - and sooner rather than
            later. The perfect way to alert people to circumstantial changes
            instantly is via an SMS Notification System.
